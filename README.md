## Code Example Repo 1

This repo is a personal project that I'm working on. The repo itself is a bit older, I started working on it at the beginning of the year but realised that all of it needed to be ported over to a new architecture. It is currently implemented in JAVA. This however is only a piece of the system as I implemented a microservice architecture although this particular service has grown a bit past a micro service.

To get to the source code navigate to 'src > main > java'. The directories you find there are the project structure.

## Code Example Repo 2

This is one of my latest projects I have worked on. This is a solidity contract that I pulled from the public blockchain. I was unauthorised to share the repo so I only pulled the contract code as it is publicly available. The contract consists of the one file. It is developed in solidity, a language close to C#. There is a few constraints. The contract cannot support doubles/float, it cannot be bigger than 24kb. So error messages has been made smaller to ensure that the compiled contract is smaller, and numerators and denominators are used for floats.

# I hope this gives insight into myself as a developer.
